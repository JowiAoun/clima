// The gallery's entry point. Four things happen, and the interesting one is the
// thing that does not.
//
// app/main.cpp calls Settings::prepareStorage() before anything else, because
// the weather app remembers its window size and its units. This calls it too,
// and the rule it used to state — a developer tool has no business writing to
// the config directory the product reads — is kept by the FILE rather than by
// the directory: `clima-gallery.ini` sits beside `clima.ini` and nothing in
// this process can reach the second one. Open the gallery at 1500x950 and the
// app still opens where the reader left it.
//
// It used to set no organisation at all, which meant it read no preferences
// file whatsoever and every preference it showed was a default. That was
// invisible until the clock format's default started following the reader's
// locale: the seven gallery cards carrying a time went 24-hour under the
// capture locale while every app image stayed 12-hour, so the component
// browser was drawing something the product does not. A gallery that renders
// the app's components in the app's typeface should read the app's
// preferences too — and scripts/golden.sh pins them for a capture by writing
// exactly this file.
//
// AppFont::install() is the opposite case — the one piece of app/main.cpp this
// file must copy. The specimens on the stage are the app's own components out
// of the app's own module, and a review of them in a different typeface is a
// review of something the product does not ship.
