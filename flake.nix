# This exists because "install the toolchain" is not a thing two machines can be
# asked to do and agree on. Qt 6, CMake, Ninja, clang-format, reuse and
# appstreamcli are five different package managers' worth of versions, and the
# ones that matter here — the Qt version the QML is written against, the
# clang-format that decides what the C++ looks like — are exactly the ones
# distros disagree about. A golden-image test cannot be reproducible on top of
# a toolchain that is not.
#
# The tool list and the shell hook are in nix/devshell.nix, shared with
# shell.nix so that flake and non-flake users get the same shell.

  # point of this file is that it does not.
  #
  # nixos-26.05 is the current stable channel and carries Qt 6.11.1, CMake 4.1.6
  # and Ninja 1.13.2. D2 sets the floor at Qt 6.8 LTS and asks that we develop
  # against 6.9+, and 6.11 is what the prototype has been running against all
  # along — run.sh picks the highest qtdeclarative in the store, which on this
  # machine is 6.11.1. Pinning to anything older would quietly change what the
  # prototype renders. Features newer than 6.8 stay behind version guards, which
  # is a code review question, not a toolchain one.
  #
  # flake.lock turns "the branch" into one revision. That file is the actual
  # reproducibility guarantee; this URL only says where the next `nix flake
  # update` should look.
