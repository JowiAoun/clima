# Every gate CI runs, in one command, before you push.
#
#   scripts/preflight.sh          all of it; configures and builds if needed
#   scripts/preflight.sh --fast   only the checks that read the tree
#
# CLIMAT_BUILD_DIR selects the build; it defaults to build/dev.
#
# ---- why this exists --------------------------------------------------------
#
# CONTRIBUTING.md used to end with six commands to run before pushing, and CI
# runs thirteen. The gap is not a documentation problem: nobody types thirteen
# commands, so what actually happened was that a pull request went red on the
# fourteenth minute of a CI run over something `reuse` would have said in two
# seconds.
#
# So the list lives here, in the order that finds a problem soonest - the checks
# that need no build first, the ones that need a built tree after, the ones that
# render pictures last. Every one of them keeps running after a failure and the
# summary at the end is the whole list, because the answer to "what else is
# wrong" should not cost another twenty minutes.
#
# It is deliberately not a pre-commit hook. A hook that takes twenty minutes is
# a hook people learn to pass --no-verify to, and a gate nobody runs is worse
# than no gate at all: it is a gate everybody believes in.
