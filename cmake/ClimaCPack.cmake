# The .deb, via CPack.
#
# Included from the top-level CMakeLists.txt and not from packaging/, because
# CPack reads its variables out of the directory that includes it and a
# subdirectory's `set` does not reach the parent scope. A CPack configured one
# directory down produces a package with a default name, no dependencies and no
# description, and reports success.
#
# ==== who this .deb is for, and who it is not for ============================
#
# It installs on Debian 13 and Ubuntu 26.04 or newer, and it does not install on
# Ubuntu 24.04. That is not a limitation to be worked around: 24.04 ships
# Qt 6.4.2, our floor is 6.8, and a package that installs and then fails to
# start is worse than one that refuses. 24.04 users get the Flatpak, which
# carries its own Qt — see packaging/flatpak/, and docs/known-gaps.md, which
# says so in the place a user will look.
#
# The dependency list is not written here. CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS reads
# the built binary's DT_NEEDED entries and asks dpkg which packages provide
# them, so the list is derived from what we actually linked rather than from
# what somebody believed we linked. It follows that THIS MUST BE BUILT AGAINST
# SYSTEM QT. Run it under Nix and shlibdeps resolves libQt6Quick.so.6 to a
# /nix/store path, finds no Debian package owning it, and either fails or emits
# a package that depends on nothing. CI builds it in debian:trixie for exactly
# this reason; scripts/deb.sh does the same thing locally through docker.

# ---- Windows: the portable ZIP ----------------------------------------------
#
# The MSI is not built here. CPack's WIX generator wants WiX v3, which is
# end-of-life, and the installer we ship is authored in v5 — see
# packaging/windows/clima.wxs, which the release workflow builds with the
# `wix` dotnet tool against the same staged install this ZIP is made from.
#
# So CPack's job on Windows is the staging and the archive, and that is worth
# having on its own: docs/07-packaging.md §7.1 lists a portable ZIP as P1, for
# people who will not run an installer.

# the leading space that Debian's format requires, so a string that already has
# one comes out indented by two on every line but the last.
#
# The lone "." is Debian's paragraph separator and passes through as-is.
