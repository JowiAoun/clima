// Every alert in force here, in full.
//
// A sheet over the page for the same reason PlacePicker is one: reading a
// warning is a detour, not a destination. You come back to the weather you were
// looking at, and on the desktop there is nothing to push a screen onto.
//
// ---- what it says when it cannot say everything -----------------------------
//
// Two admissions live at the bottom of this sheet, and they are separate
// sentences because they are separate facts:
//
//   "Some alert sources could not be reached"  — a whole service did not
//       answer. There may be warnings here we have never seen. This is
//       AlertSet::complete, and it is the reason alerts fan out across every
//       covering provider instead of falling through a chain.
//
//   "Last confirmed HH:MM"  — we are showing an alert whose issuer was due to
//       refresh it and whom we could not reach. The alert is real; our copy of
//       it is old.
//
// Neither is decoration. docs/06-roadmap.md §6.6's requirement is that no
// *ended* alert is displayed; this is the other half of the same promise —
// never silently keep an alert, and never silently drop one.
//
// `Bound` because this file has Repeater delegates that read ids from the file
// around them, which qmllint reports as unqualified access and qmlcachegen
// cannot ahead-of-time compile. Bound scoping is what makes those lookups
// resolvable; the delegates already declare their model roles as `required`,
// which is the other half of what it asks for.
