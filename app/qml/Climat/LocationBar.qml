    // The alternative was to make the bar 44 and it moved every page in the app
    // down by 18 px — a whole-page diff on eleven golden images to make room for
    // air around two marks that had not changed size. The rule this file ended

    // The chevron and the home marker are two different actions — open the

    // a 14 px target and a 24 px one. Two 44 px targets need 88 px between their
    // outer edges and cannot be conjured out of 48; growing them in place would
    // have made each one steal half the other's taps, which is worse than
    // leaving both small.
    //
    // So the cells are the floor and the spacing goes to zero, which puts 15 px
    // of air between the name and the chevron where there were 10, and 25 px
    // between the chevron and the home ring where there were 10. That reads as
    // a deliberate separation of two unlike controls rather than as a gap — and
    // it is the only part of this bar that moved. See `implicitHeight`.

        // panel.
