// The mobile shell's navigation: five destinations from mobiletabs.js, one
// selected, along the bottom of a phone and down the left of a landscape
// tablet.
//
// It is the only piece of persistent chrome this shell has, so it is also the
// only thing on the screen allowed to be more opaque than a wash.
//
// ---- one component, two orientations ------------------------------------------
// This was BottomNav until a tablet in landscape needed the same five targets
// somewhere else. A second file would have been the obvious split and it would
// have been two copies of the pill, the model, the tokens and the tint
// animation kept in step by hand — and the pill is the part that is easiest to
// get subtly wrong and hardest to notice.
//
// So the *arrangement* is the property and everything else is shared.
// `Viewports.navStyle` decides which arrangement, not this file: the same
// question is asked about the content columns, and one place has to answer
// both or a rail can appear beside a layout that did not make room for it.
//
// ---- why this is not translucent ----------------------------------------------
// §10.1 says every surface is a thin white wash over the page gradient, and
// that rule is right everywhere the surface sits *in* the page. This one sits
// *over* it: the page scrolls underneath, so at 0.07 the reader would watch a
// temperature curve slide through the word "Hourly". The pager buttons already
// established the exception — a thing that floats over moving content is
// tinted and mostly opaque — and `surface.nav` is that token for this bar.
//
// The hairline along the leading edge is the second half of the same decision.
// §10.1 warns off borders because a border across a junction is the seam the
// junction exists to hide, but this is not a junction: it is the edge where a
// floating bar stops and scrolling content begins, and it is the only cue that
// the content continues behind it. Which edge that is follows the arrangement
// — the top of a bottom bar, the right of a left rail.
//
// ---- motion ------------------------------------------------------------------
// The pill slides between tabs rather than cutting, at `move`, because it is
// the one element here that is genuinely the same object in a new place. It
// slides along whichever axis the bar runs. The glyphs and labels tint at
// `tint`. Nothing else moves, and nothing moves on a timer — the bar is at
// rest until it is touched.
//
// `Bound` because the cell is a Component instantiated by two Repeaters, and a
// Component is a scope of its own — every `root.` inside it reads as unqualified
// access to qmllint and cannot be ahead-of-time compiled by qmlcachegen. Bound
// scoping is what makes those lookups resolvable; the delegate already declares
// its model role as `required`, which is the other half of what it asks for.
