// The phone and tablet shell: five destinations under a bottom nav.
//
// The desktop answer to "what is the weather doing" is one tall scrolling page
// — WeatherPage — because a 1340 px window can afford to put the hero, the
// hourly chart and twelve detail cards in the same column and let the reader
// scroll. A phone cannot: the same page at 390 px is roughly eight screens
// deep, and the fourth of them is unreachable in any sense that matters.
//
// So the phone splits the page rather than shrinking it, and the split is the
// reference's: today, the rest of today, the rest of the month, the map, and
// settings. mobiletabs.js is the list.
//
// ---- motion ------------------------------------------------------------------
// The nav pill slides; the page does not transition. That is a decision and
// not an omission.
//
// A fade-through between two full screens is the obvious thing to add here and
// it is the wrong thing to add here. §10.6's rule is that the reader can read
// the component at rest position zero, and the whole content area of a phone
// is the worst possible place to break it: a reader who tapped "Hourly" is
// waiting on the one thing they asked for. The pill is what has to move,
// because the pill is what changed — it is the same object in a new place, and
// watching it travel is what tells you the bar has five positions and you are
// now at the second. The page underneath is not a transition, it is a
// destination.

    // release unaccepted. So one tap of Escape closed the sheet on the way down
    // and changed the tab on the way up: two navigations from one key, and the
