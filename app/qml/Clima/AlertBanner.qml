// The severe-weather banner: one alert, never a stack.
//
// ---- one, and a count -------------------------------------------------------
//
// Seattle had four alerts in force at one coordinate on the afternoon they were
// recorded, and a banner that stacked them would have pushed the temperature
// below the fold to tell a reader about three air quality advisories and a heat
// advisory at equal weight. So the banner shows the highest-ranked alert and
// says "+3 more"; the sheet is where the rest live.
//
// Ranking is libclima's — AlertSet::displayableAt() sorts by severity, then
// urgency, then certainty, then onset — so this file makes no decision about
// which alert is the important one. It only draws the answer.
//
// ---- dismissal is acknowledgement -------------------------------------------
//
// The close control collapses this to a one-line strip. It does not remove the
// alert, and the strip is still tappable, still names the event and still
// carries the severity colour and glyph. An alert that could be made to vanish
// is an alert whose banner people learn to dismiss reflexively; a strip that
// stays is a reminder that costs one line of the screen.
//
// An update that RAISES the severity un-acknowledges — see
// app/viewmodels/alertsdata.h, which owns that rule and the storage behind it.
//
// ---- where this is not ------------------------------------------------------
//
// Not inside WeatherPage's Flickable, and not inside any of the five mobile
// pages. On the desktop the Flickable sets `layer.enabled: true` and a banner
// inside it would scroll away from a warning the reader has not read yet. On
// the phone MobileShell destroys and rebuilds its page on every tab change, so
// a per-page banner would be constructed five times in a session and would
// re-run its entrance each time — a tornado warning that re-animates when you
// look at the map.
//
// ---- motion -----------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The height change on collapse, and nothing else. §10.6's rule is that a
// component is readable at rest position zero, and here that is not a style
// preference: an alert that arrives with an entrance animation is an alert that
// is unreadable for 200 ms, and the reader who most needs it is the one glancing
// at the screen. So it appears at full opacity, at full height, immediately.
//
// `Bound` because this file has Repeater delegates that read ids from the file
// around them, which qmllint reports as unqualified access and qmlcachegen
// cannot ahead-of-time compile. Bound scoping is what makes those lookups
// resolvable; the delegates already declare their model roles as `required`,
// which is the other half of what it asks for.
